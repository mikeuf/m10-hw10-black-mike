I used s3schools and stackoverflow for this assignment.

My main challenge was that after running the npm run build, I checked the main.js file and didn't see any transpilation. This morning I removed and reinstalled node and re-ran through the same process and still didn't notice a difference.
But then I noticed that the "consts" were turned into "vars" and that the arrow functions had been translated. So it was working all along (I think).
